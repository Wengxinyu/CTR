# CTR

Implementing the model and evaluating hyperparameters with the help of scikit-learn.

The iPinYou Dataset we used in this project contains 23 features and 1 target label (Click). 
Before the data is trained, these 23 features are evaluated from their type, the number of unique value, the minimum, the maximum, the average, the standard deviation and value distribution. 
This is implemented by Dato with the package graphlab https://turi.com/products/create/
